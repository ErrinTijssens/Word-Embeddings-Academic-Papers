# Word-Embeddings-Academic-Papers
This project analyses word embeddings of computer science abstracts to understand how language related to AI risks have changed in the academic computer science literature.

It focuses on two things in particular:

1) It examines whether there are linguistic differences between regular academic papers and 'collaboration' papers. Collaboration papers are academic papers that are written by an author that is affiliated with Big Tech.

2) It examines whether the language surrounding AI risks has changed after the introduction of ChatGPT/popularisation of LLMs.
